<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In this simulation, you can observe how a
skater moves across frictionless ice in response to the pull of an elastic
cord. The skater starts motionless and your job is to exert a force on the
skater. You exert that force by touching the skater with the mouse pointer and
pressing the mouse button. An elastic cord then appears between the skater and
the mouse pointer, and you can stretch that cord by moving the mouse pointer to
the right or left. As the cord stretches, the skater experiences a force toward
the mouse pointer. The more you stretch the cord, the stronger that force
becomes. When you release the mouse button, the cord releases the skater and
the skater no longer experiences a force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To help you control how hard you pull on
the skater, you can choose one of three different elastic cord pull strengths:
small, medium, and large. The larger the cord’s pull strength, the more force
it exerts on the skater as you stretch it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US> You can also adjust the skater’s mass over
a range from 20 kg to 100 kg. A child of 20 kg will respond differently to a
given force than a large man of 100 kg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>To begin experimenting with the simulation,
place the mouse pointer on the skater, press the mouse button, and drag the
mouse pointer to the right. You’ll see the elastic cord stretch and the skater
begin to move. You’ll also see arrows indicating the force that the elastic
cord is exerting on the skater and two of the skater’s quantities of motion:
acceleration and velocity. Release the mouse button. The elastic cord will
vanish, along with its force, but the skater will continue to move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You can stretch or release the cord
repeatedly by pressing or releasing the mouse button. Notice that to exert a
constant force on the skater, you must move the mouse with the skater so that
the length of the elastic cord doesn’t change. See if you can make the skater
travel back and forth across the ice. Can you bring the moving skater to a
stop? How does the skater move if you keep your end of the elastic cord at a
fixed point on the ice?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the skater skates off the ice, you can
return the skater to the center by pressing the “Reset skater” button. </span></p>
